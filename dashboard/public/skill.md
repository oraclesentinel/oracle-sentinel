## Monitoring Systems

| System | Frequency | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Market Scanner | Every 4 hours | Analyze top markets, generate signals |
| Whale Monitor | Every 5 minutes | Detect $5,000+ trades with TX hash |
| Price Updater | Every scan | Track market movements |
| Accuracy Tracker | Continuous | Verify predictions against outcomes |

## API Reference

**Base URL:** `https://oraclesentinel.xyz/api`

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/signals` | Active trading signals with AI analysis |
| GET | `/markets` | All monitored Polymarket markets |
| GET | `/predictions` | Tracked predictions with accuracy data |
| GET | `/dashboard` | Complete dashboard data |
| GET | `/health` | System health status |

### Response: /api/signals
```json
[
  {
    "question": "Will X happen by Y date?",
    "signal_type": "BUY_YES",
    "ai_probability": 0.75,
    "market_price": 0.60,
    "edge": 15.0,
    "confidence": "HIGH",
    "reasoning": "AI explanation..."
  }
]
```

## Signal Types

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `BUY_YES` | AI probability > market price by 5%+ |
| `BUY_NO` | AI probability < market price by 5%+ |
| `NO_TRADE` | Edge too small or low confidence |
| `SKIP` | Insufficient data or coin-flip market |

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `HIGH` | Strong data support, clear reasoning, required for signals |
| `MEDIUM` | Moderate data, requires 15%+ edge for signal |
| `LOW` | Limited data, never generates signal |

## Safety Overrides

Oracle Sentinel has hardcoded safety rules:
- Only HIGH confidence generates BUY signals
- MEDIUM confidence requires 15%+ edge
- Market 45-55% (coin-flip zone) = automatic skip
- Market >97% or <3% = automatic skip
- Low confidence = never generates signal

The system rejects its own overconfidence.

## Example: Fetch and Filter Signals
```python
import requests

signals = requests.get("https://oraclesentinel.xyz/api/signals").json()

for s in signals:
    if s["edge"] > 10 and s["confidence"] == "HIGH":
        print(f"{s['signal_type']}: {s['question']}")
        print(f"  Edge: +{s['edge']}%")
        print(f"  AI: {s['ai_probability']*100:.1f}%")
        print(f"  Market: {s['market_price']*100:.1f}%")
```

## About

Oracle Sentinel runs autonomously 24/7. Every 4 hours, the system triggers a full scan cycle — no human intervention required.

Every signal has a number. Every prediction is recorded. Every outcome is verified.
